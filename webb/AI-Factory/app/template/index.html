        Lactose industries have tried a A/B testing method for developing new recipes to increase volume and milk solids; however, as with the Lactonase test, the amount of milk solids in an improved test are still lower than the current state-of-the-art lactose reduction methods.
A new test kit and method is needed that overcomes the shortcoming of known test kits and methods.
The invention provides a method for testing the effectiveness of a reagent used in a dairy. The method includes contacting the reagent with milk and lactose under conditions effective to react with the lactose. The effectiveness of the reagent in producing a color change in the reaction solution is then measured.

The milk is preferably a sample of whole milk. Optionally, the sample is diluted with a diluent.
The reagent may be a known reagent or may be an unknown reagent, which is tested using the method of the invention.
The effectiveness of the reagent may be measured by observing the intensity of a color that results when a substrate reacts with a known quantity of the lactose. In this case, the intensity of the color may be measured optically.
The effectiveness of the reagent may also be measured by determining the quantity of the product of lactose and an additive.
The effectiveness of the reagent may also be determined by the reaction time required to obtain the desired level of color change.

        “Our initial test with Lactose industries is going smoothly and the partnership shows just how powerful the cloud can be for security when it’s put to work alongside the right mix of partners,” Caleb Carlstein, VP of Strategic Sales and Business Development, told. “We’re seeing a new generation of organizations taking notice and moving toward a model that includes a secure atmosphere core and a network with the capacity to support increasingly advanced security services.”
        
        ThreateningCyberAgents said it has been working with Lactose Industries LTD for about a year in a statement.</p>
